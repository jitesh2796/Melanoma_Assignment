## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- We have training data of around 2.5k images corresponding to one of nine classes of skin diseases
- The dataset is an imbalanced dataset, we have augmnented data to add extra samples of the images

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We have built a CNN model which is able to correctly identify Melanoma with 78% accuracy
- The Model was overfitting with the imbalanced data and without any regularization
- The model is performning well after data augmentation and adding regularization
